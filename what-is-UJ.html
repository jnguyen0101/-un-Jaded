        A mental health and service organization intended to destigmatize mental health and encourage social
        advocacy amongst the AAPI community. (un)Jaded recognizes the need for a culturally aware space that is
        committed to celebrating Asian identities, addressing intersectional issues, and promoting greater community
        involvement. Membership is open to self-identified Asians, Pacific Islanders, Asian Americans, and allies
        attending the University of Texas at Austin.

              <p>
                (un)Jaded will forever occupy a soft spot in my heart — Kai-Lin, J, and I started it as a simple desire
                for community, but it grew rapidly far beyond us. I think its success is a testament to the need for
                open conversation and community building among AAPI, particularly to advance mental health and social
                justice. My favorite part of the organization was always just talking in circles after one of the
                workshops, getting to know people in a way that required some vulnerability.
              </p>
              <p>
                (un)Jaded always attracted the best people, and in it, I found some lifelong friends. People have told
                me that finding (un)Jaded was what helped get them through the social isolation of COVID and college. As
                the organization continues to grow and change, I hope it always occupies a space at UT driven to provide
                such a community.

            <h3>Kai-Lin Wei</h3>
            <p>
              (un)Jaded was inspired by the countless conversations between Abby, J, and myself surrounding belonging,
              wellness, and connection among AAPI students at UT. We were proud of our heritages but bonded over the
              way certain traditional values or generational gaps in cultural understanding could chafe up against our
              American upbringing. As freshmen in 2019, we were all actively searching for AAPI communities on campus
              but couldn't find one that specifically focused on building the skills to navigate these tensions. The
              vision was to not only bring AAPI students together, but create a highly intentional space where
              vulnerabilities could be shared and true community built.
            </p>
            <p>
              A beautiful community, incredible learning experiences, and lifelong relationships have come out of this
              project. Abby and J are, to this day, the best friends I continuously look to for advice and
              inspiration. We're pursuing different careers, living in different cities, and chasing different dreams
              — on my end, I'm wrapping up a cross-country move from San Francisco to start a new role at Google New
              York this summer — but I think we still all fundamentally care about the same things. We're inspired by
              our
              people. We're committed to carrying our histories with pride while still feeling empowered to explore new
              paths to prosperity. And we're thrilled to see what the next generation of AAPI Americans will bring to
              our
              ever-evolving culture. At this point, we're ready to learn from you!

            <h3>Jannel Hayden</h3>
            <p>
              Loud. Opinionated. Argumentative. These were the words used to describe me, but always with some negative
              connotation. Eventually, I fell into the pattern of taking up less space, catering to the comfort of those
              who didn't care about what I had to say. But the truth is, some things just need to be heard, and often
              times, the voices that are silenced are the ones that challenge the systems keeping us all quiet in the
              first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we push ourselves to have these difficult conversations about race, privilege, and social equality,
              we open doors for growth and create power in community. Conversation is the first step toward
              transformation, and creating a platform for AAPI voices to be heard is my way of fighting back.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm here to take up space.
